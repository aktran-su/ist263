<h1>Alyssa Tran's Biography</h1>

<p>
Hello! My name is Alyssa Tran and I am dual majored in Finance and Information Management & Technology. Within Finance I am interested in commodities markets while in my IMT major I have an interest in cybersecurity within the entertainment industry. 
</p>   
    
<p> 
At Syracuse University I am an honors student, and this summer I was lucky enough to land an internship at EY, a big four accounting firm. I have a list of skills ranging from Microsoft Excel, Python, Communication, and my personal favorite, the ability to write!

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>
Outside of school, I love to journal, travel, go to concerts, crochet, play the electric guitar, and read. Just this past year, I studied abroad in London and traveled to many different countries on the weekend. Some of my favorites include Prague, Barcelona, and Amsterdam! Besides travel, many of my interests stem from living in such a diverse city since I grew up with easy access to various entertainment opportunities in New York City. What most people don’t know about me is that I love English and I have an interest in journalism and creative writing later in life. My favorite classes have been those that encourage me to challenge different pieces of literature and form my own interpretations. I’m excited to begin my career and eventually write for The New Yorker!
